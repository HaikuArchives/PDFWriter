Known Bugs/Limitations

- Limited alpha transparency support only (bitmap/pattern only)
- Not all drawing modes supported
- No security settings support.

Note
- BePDF until version 0.9.4 does not take the alpha channel of transparent bitmaps or patterns into account;
  Acrobat Reader shows them properly!
