Known Bugs/Limitations

- Limited alpha transparency support only (bitmap/pattern only)
- Not all drawing modes supported
- No security settings support.
- Clipping to inverse BPicture not supported

Note
- BePDF does not take the alpha channel of transparent bitmaps or patterns into account;
  Acrobat Reader shows them properly!
